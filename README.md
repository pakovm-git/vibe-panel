Vibe Panel is a vibe coded extension that vibes with your shell.
Made exclusively for those who enjoy Gnome's default looks but want to make it vibe a little more.

### Features:
- Dynamic transparency
- Opacity when a window is near
- Panel corners (that follow the panel's transparency)
- Option to remove the corners when the panel is transparent
- Compatibility with [Luminus Shell](https://gitlab.com/dikasetyaprayogi/luminus-project)
